# E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis with MySQL
This repository encompasses a variety of business analytics projects including **SQL**, **Tableau**, and **PowerPoint**.

## 1. Overview 
This project focuses on analysing e-commerce sales performance data using **MySQL Workbench** for data analysis, **Tableau** for data visualisation, and **PowerPoint** for presenting database structure. By leveraging these tools, our aim is to gain insights into website traffic across channels, product sales and refund trends, and customer behaviours.

## 2. Major Tools 
- SQL queries 
- MySQL Workbench 
- Tableau Public 
- PowerPoint

## 3. Database Overview
The e-commerce database is composed of six tables, encompassing a wealth of information on website traffic, product details, order history, and refund records. Below is the schema diagram created using **PowerPoint**.
